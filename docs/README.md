  ## Description
  Early design for an  initial webpage to act as a portfolio for us to add our work over the course of the program, so that we have a place to show our progress as well as our     skills.

  This was done at an early stage in bootcamp and is mostly raw html, css, and flex.

  ## Thoughts
  This was incredibly difficult to get started. At this point I still don't have a broad working knowledge of html and css so a lot of time was spent searching out and reading     tutorials, looking back at earlier class excercises for hints, using the chrom tools to inspect pages from earlier projects, and inspecting live webpages to see how and where   certain code was deployed to figure out how to make certain things work. 

  The skeleton for the html portion was probably ths simplest part. When it came to the css however there was a lot of throwing the kitchen sink at the various classes and tags   to get things in order as well as trial and error tweaking in the chrome developer tools to see what looked good/right and setting the style sheet accordingly.  The same goes   for utilizing flex.  

  There are certain places I'm not entirely sure how or why something worked or didn't work even if I did get it to work in the end. I am certain there are redundancies and non   semantic code in the style sheet and html that I will catch and streamline as I add to, and tweak this page over the coming months but right now it works. It meets the grading   criteria (for the most part) and right now I consider that a victory!
