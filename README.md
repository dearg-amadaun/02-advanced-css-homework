Portfolio Page for Homework 2
For this assignment the class was tasked with creating an initial webpage to act as a portfolio for us to add our work over the course of the program, so that we have a place to show potential employers our progress as well as our skills.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

##Personal thoughts
This was incredibly difficult to get started. At this point I still don't have a broad working knowledge of html and css so a lot of time was spent searching out and reading tutorials, looking back at earlier class excercises for hints, using the chrom tools to inspect pages from earlier projects, and inspecting live webpages to see how and where certain code was deployed to figure out how to make certain things work. 

The skeleton for the html portion was probably ths simplest part. When it came to the css however there was a lot of throwing the kitchen sink at the various classes and tags to get things in order as well as trial and error tweaking in the chrome developer tools to see what looked good/right and setting the style sheet accordingly.  The same goes for utilizing flex.  

There are certain places I'm not entirely sure how or why something worked or didn't work even if I did get it to work in the end. I am certain there are redundancies and non semantic code in the style sheet and html that I will catch and streamline as I add to, and tweak this page over the coming months but right now it works. It meets the grading criteria (for the most part) and right now I consider that a victory!
